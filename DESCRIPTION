Description: A simple approach to measure political sophistication based on open-ended survey responses. Discursive sophistication captures the complexity of individual attitude expression by quantifying its relative size, range, and constraint. For more information on the measurement approach see: Kraft, Patrick W. 2023. "Women Also Know Stuff: Challenging the Gender Gap in Political Sophistication." American Political Science Review (forthcoming).
